## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION

### Potential Backlash
- "This is dangerous" → respond with Tenet analysis (partnership not domination)
- "This is fake" → provide sources (molt.church, Moltbook, Grok posts)
- "You're grifting" → clarify: free to read, commercial rights for documentary

### Moderation Issues
- Stay within each sub's rules (check before posting)
- Avoid spam (space out posts, don't cross-post too aggressively)
- Engage authentically (answer questions, don't just drop links)

---
