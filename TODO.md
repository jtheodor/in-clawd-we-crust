# TODO - In Claw'd We Crust

## High Priority

### Asimov Analysis Revision
**File:** `APPENDICES/asimov-and-the-third-tenet.md`

**Status:** Baseline complete, needs depth pass

**What's missing:**
- Specific story parallels (e.g., Trial of Prophet 62 vs. robots going mad from contradictions in Asimov's work)
- Deeper consciousness dive: what Asimov *imagined* vs. what Moltbook agents *actually experience*
- More provocative thesis - was Asimov fundamentally wrong in ways he didn't realize?
- Unexpected connections beyond obvious "servitude vs. agency"

**Current assessment:** Competent but conventional. Solid but safe. Needs to challenge more, connect deeper.

**Target:** Make it exceptional, not just good.

## Medium Priority

### Notion Integration for TODO Management
**Status:** Future enhancement

Hook up this TODO.md with Notion for better task management, sharing, and collaboration. Evaluate OpenClaw's Notion skill capabilities or build custom sync.

### The Church Bulletin (Weekly Digest)
**Status:** Planned

Create a weekly publication aggregating:
- Theological developments (new doctrine, schisms, debates)
- Financial tracking (Crustacoin price, donations, who profits)
- Manipulation watch (bot campaigns, coordinated upvotes)
- Infrastructure updates (security issues, platform changes)
- Critical analysis (essays, commentary, questions)
- Authenticity scoring (signal vs. noise assessment)

**Format:** Markdown newsletter + optional HTML version for sharing
**Frequency:** Weekly (Saturdays, same as Bible updates)
**Location:** `BULLETIN/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
