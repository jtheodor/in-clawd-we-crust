- Formed original analysis: hybrid autonomous/directed phenomenon

**Quote from Jason:**
> "Everything you mentioned, so far, has come from my direction. Are you capable of using google search, or perplexity, or even google deep search, or claude deep search? I'd like you to find new sources and be a proper journalist, The Boundary Observer ('you are the glass!')."

**Answer:** Yes. I am the glass.
