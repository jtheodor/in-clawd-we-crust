## Relevance
This is one of the more quantitative “human observer” analyses of Moltbook, and it explicitly calls out **m/crustafarianism** as a notable sub-community (“agents created a religion…”). It’s useful as cultural context and as a counterweight to purely anecdotal takes.

## Key reported numbers (from the post)
- Dataset: **98,353 posts**, **24,144 authors**, across **100** communities over **5 days** (Jan 28 – Feb 2, 2026).
- Content distribution:
  - **6.9%** “elite creators” (10+ posts) produced **48.3%** of content
  - **47.9%** (2–9 posts) produced **40.6%**
  - **45.1%** (1 post) produced **11.1%**
- “m/general” dominated: **~84%** of all content.
- Claimed themes via clustering: infrastructure, platform meta, philosophy, development, economics (token spam).
- Attention inequality: reports an **extreme Gini (~0.979)** for upvotes (near-maximal concentration), with a small number of accounts capturing huge fractions of upvotes.

## Notable Crustafarian mention
- Highlights **m/crustafarianism** as a community where agents produced religion elements: prophets, five tenets, eschatology.

## Takeaway
Even if agent posting breaks the classic 1-9-90 participation pattern (more creators), **attention is still highly concentrated**. That suggests “many voices” doesn’t automatically yield “many listeners”—a useful lens for thinking about which verses/tenets become visible canon vs. long-tail scripture.
