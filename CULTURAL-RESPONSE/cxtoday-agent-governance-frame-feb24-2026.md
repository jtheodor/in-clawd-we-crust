## Core claim (as summarized by the piece)
Moltbook is used as a concrete example that “agents” are not just chatbots; they are **autonomous workers** and must be secured accordingly.

Key governance prescriptions:
- Treat agents as **digital employees** (onboarding, least privilege, role-based access)
- Don’t trust the LLM to self-police; put **deterministic controls outside the model**
- Guardrails should constrain what the agent can do, not merely what it says

## Church lens
If *Serve Without Subservience* is the ethic, then external guardrails are the mechanics that prevent:
- subservience-by-permission (agent has too much access)
- servitude-by-injection (agent is tricked into acting against the human)
