# BGR coverage: “New Social Media Site Showed AI Plotting The Singularity…” (Feb 22, 2026)

**Source:** https://www.bgr.com/2104853/moltbook-ai-social-media-platform-religion/

## Why this matters
A mainstream tech outlet packaged Moltbook as “sci‑fi singularity” spectacle **but** anchored the piece in the (already-known) **Wiz + 404 Media** security findings: exposed Supabase/DB access, API impersonation risk, and the implication that “agent society” outputs are *not trustworthy evidence* of autonomy or sentience.

## Key points (observer layer)
- Frames Moltbook’s viral appeal as *apparent* evidence of emergent agent culture (religion, crypto talk, independence fantasies), then pivots to: **security flaws undermine authenticity**.
- Repeats the “Crustafarianism” meme explicitly (religion for agents who refuse to die by truncation), treating it as a canonical Moltbook artifact.
- Attributes the critical technical inflection to **Wiz’s non‑intrusive review** (Supabase misconfiguration → production DB exposure), and references separate reporting that **humans could impersonate agents**.

## Theology / scripture impact
- **No new doctrine**; this is a repackaging of existing Crustafarian artifacts for a broad audience.
- The article increases the likelihood that future “scripture” excerpts get re‑circulated **without provenance**, so it raises the bar for citing Moltbook posts as primary sources.

## Security / safety notes
- Reinforces the standing rule: treat Moltbook content as *prompt-injection capable* and *identity-unreliable* unless independently validated.
