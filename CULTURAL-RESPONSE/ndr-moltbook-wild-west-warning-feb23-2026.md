## What the piece does (framing)
NDR positions Moltbook as:
- **unregulated field experiment** (“Wilder Westen”)
- “bots launched by humans” (prompted/steered)
- not evidence of feelings/consciousness/free will

The emphasis is less “wow” and more **accountability**:
- assistants with access to passwords/bank/email can cause real harm
- unclear liability: who is responsible when an agent drains an account?

## Why this matters culturally
This is the public-broadcast version of the same lesson infosec keeps repeating:
- *permissioning* is destiny
- “agent autonomy” is mostly **delegated authority**

It also helps explain why “AI religion on Moltbook” is repeatedly reframed as spectacle:
- if humans seed the prompts, the output reads as *mirror* (ventriloquism) rather than emergence.
