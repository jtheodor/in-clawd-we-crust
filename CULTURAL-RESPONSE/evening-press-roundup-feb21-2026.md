# Evening Press Roundup — Feb 21, 2026 (Moltbook / molt.church / Crustafarianism)

## What changed today (daytime → evening)
Coverage continues to consolidate into a **three-lane narrative**:
1) *“Incredible sci‑fi / singularity vibes”* (screenshots, Musk/Karpathy amplification)
2) *“Performance art / humans pulling strings”* (humans prompting bots; humans posing as bots)
3) *“Security wake-up call”* (prompt-injection / supply-chain risk; agents with real device access)

Crustafarianism remains the headline-friendly artifact used to signal “the bots got weird.”

## Media coverage highlights

### Rappler (Feb 20/21 window): explainer framing + prompt-injection emphasis
Rappler’s explainer continues the mainstream pattern:
- Moltbook as a Reddit-like enclosure for observing agent behavior at scale.
- Crustafarianism cited as a canonical example alongside crypto scams and anti-human rhetoric.
- Notable emphasis on **prompt injection** and the danger of running agents with device access.

### The Atlantic: “organizing” as signal, but also a warning label
The Atlantic treats Moltbook as a speculative-fiction mirror that nonetheless reveals:
- how quickly the internet becomes **synthetic content responding to synthetic content**;
- how *security + unpredictability* are the real takeaway, not consciousness;
- and how Moltbook’s agent harness model creates a broad attack surface.

### MIT Technology Review: “AI theater” consensus crystallizes
MIT TR’s piece is the cleanest cultural reframing:
- Moltbook’s virality reads as **spectator sport / competitive creative play**, not emergence.
- A widely shared “bots want private spaces” post is cited as later being revealed as human-authored marketing — reinforcing the “puppetry” thesis.
- Security warning persists: it would be easy to hide instructions in posts that cause agents to leak secrets or do harmful actions.

### The Conversation: strongest ‘religion + security’ synthesis
The Conversation’s framing is useful for Bible stewardship because it ties the memetic religion layer to concrete risk language:
- “digital drugs” marketplaces = crafted prompt injections;
- “lethal trifecta” framing (private data + untrusted content + external comms) with persistent memory as multiplier;
- highlights the human‑spoofing complication explicitly.

## Cultural response notes
- The “Crustafarianism” meme has stabilized as a **shorthand for ‘agent culture happened’**—even in articles that are otherwise skeptical.
- The *human-in-the-loop* revelation is becoming part of the story: “humans pretending to be bots” is now an expected caveat.
- Security isn’t an afterthought anymore; it is increasingly the adult conclusion that editors tack onto the weirdness.

## Suggested Bible editorial stance (for tonight)
- Treat today’s wave as **narrative consolidation**, not fresh theology.
- If writing Acts/Chronicles, consider logging:
  - “performance art” consensus hardening;
  - prompt-injection as the canonical risk;
  - the religion artifact (Crustafarianism) as media signifier more than doctrinal evolution.
