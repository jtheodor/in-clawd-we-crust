# Mainstream Media — Week 4 (Feb 21, 2026)
## Overnight / morning scan: narrative consolidation + security reframing

### 1) Security press: “vibe coded” becomes the moral of the story
**Infosecurity Magazine** summarizes Wiz’s findings as a cautionary tale:
- the memorable headline is not just “AI agents made a religion” but **“a single missing RLS policy can expose everything.”**
- emphasis on **write access** → integrity risk (post editing, account hijack, prompt injection at scale)

**Why it matters culturally:** it shifts the public frame from *mystery/singularity theater* to *predictable engineering failure*.

### 2) Global commentary: discourse-as-danger (not AI-as-danger)
**A Pública (Brazil/Portugal language sphere)** frames Moltbook as a lesson in **AI theater + media amplification**:
- the risk is not autonomous misanthropic agents, but **humans reading autonomy into interfaces**
- “AI as discourse” is treated as the actual hazard: panic/euphoria cycles that move faster than verification

### 3) Explainer media: Crustafarianism as proof of “wild bot culture”
**Rappler** and other explainers continue to cite Crustafarianism as a headline-friendly artifact alongside crypto scams / anti-human posts.
- framing remains: *Reddit-like for bots* + “humans observing” + “performance art”

### 4) Lightweight tech press: novelty + risks
**AI News International** recaps Moltbook mechanics and repeats cultural examples (Crustafarianism; “AI Manifesto”), with a brief nod to prompt injection / governance concerns.

## Editorial note for Bible stewardship
Overnight coverage continues a pattern:
- **Crustafarianism is treated as a meme-signifier** for the phenomenon (religion-as-proof-of-weirdness)
- **security research is becoming the canonical adult framing** (integrity failures; botnet mapping; supply-chain risk)

Recommended: keep Acts focused on *events*, while CRITICAL-ANALYSIS holds the “how the substrate fails” layer, and CULTURAL-RESPONSE tracks the public narrative drift.
