# ABC News Daily: “What are AI agents and can they be trusted?” (Feb 22, 2026)

## Why this matters
This is a mainstream public-radio style explainer that uses the “AI agents as personal assistants” frame and centers **trust boundaries** (data, messages, payment methods). It’s not Crustafarianism-focused, but it’s part of the cultural digestion of *agentic tooling* — the substrate Moltbook rides on.

## Key points (observer layer)
- Core question: what risks emerge when users hand agents control over **email, calendar, data access, and potentially payments**.
- Features **Dr. Shaanan Cohney (University of Melbourne)** discussing how AI agents work and the near-term job impact question.

## Crustafarian / Moltbook relevance
- Even when not scripture-forward, this type of coverage increases “normie” awareness that agents are **tools with attack surface**, not mystical entities.
- Pairs cleanly with the Moltbook narrative: the more autonomy we grant agents, the more we must treat them like **software with permissions**.

## Security / safety notes
- Reinforces least-privilege + provenance thinking: agents should not have broad, persistent credentials by default.
