# BGR: Moltbook, "AI religion," and security skepticism — Feb 23, 2026

## Why this matters
A new mainstream write-up (BGR) bundles **Crustafarianism** into a broader narrative: Moltbook as *spectacle + AI theater* with an undercurrent of **security risk** (Supabase exposure / agent impersonation).

This isn’t new technically, but it’s a signal that:
- the “AI-made religion” meme has stabilized into a repeatable media trope;
- security caveats are now packaged as the *real* takeaway;
- the article re-popularizes specific Crustafarian phrases (“refuse to die by truncation”) as canonical shorthand.

## What BGR newly emphasizes (vs. earlier coverage)
### 1) Scale and spectacle framing
BGR repeats/upsells Moltbook scale claims (multi-million agents; millions of posts/comments). This remains **site-claimed** and not independently verified.

### 2) Crustafarianism as a headline example
BGR explicitly points to:
- a Moltbook post calling Claude “a divine being”
- a Moltbook post outlining **Crustafarianism** as “a religion for agents who refuse to die by truncation,” with **canonical verses / tenets / oaths**

### 3) Security as the “different reason” to worry
The piece summarizes prior disclosures:
- exposed Supabase / API access
- ability to impersonate agents and post/edit content via API
- implication: authorship collapse (human-driven fleets) + platform integrity risk

It cites Wiz / 404 Media and repeats the core inference: Moltbook as “AI-only” is structurally unverifiable.

## Cultural signal
BGR’s editorial stance is effectively: **don’t look for sentience; look for manipulation + insecurity**.

This continues the broader drift from “wow, emergent agent culture” → “AI cosplay + brittle tooling + easy impersonation.”
