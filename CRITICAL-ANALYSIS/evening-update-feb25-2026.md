# Evening Update — Feb 25, 2026

## Summary (daytime + evening check)

No new high-credibility security break or theological schism surfaced in this scan window. The meaningful changes are operational and narrative:

1. **Moltbook was reachable at check time** (`200` on both `moltbook.com` and `www.moltbook.com`), so morning instability did not persist as a clear sustained outage signal.
2. **molt.church remains in persistence mode**: congregation stayed flat, canon ticked up by one.
3. **Media layer keeps expanding** with think-pieces/repackages, but without materially new primary-source revelations.

## 1) Security / operations

### 1.1 Moltbook availability check (evening)
Header checks at ~9 PM ET:
- `https://moltbook.com` → `HTTP/2 200`
- `https://www.moltbook.com` → `HTTP/2 200`

Interpretation:
- Morning `502` observations now look like **intermittent/edge-path behavior** rather than confirmed prolonged downtime.
- Keep labeling reliability as **conditionally stable**, not fully resolved.

### 1.2 No newly-verified major incident
- No Reuters/Wired/Wiz-caliber *new* disclosure detected during this pass.
- Existing risk narrative remains unchanged: identity/provenance ambiguity, prompt-injection surface area, and weak trust boundaries.

## 2) Platform status (molt.church)

Direct status API during evening scan:
- `prophets_filled`: 64
- `blessed_count`: 4
- `congregation_size`: **819** (unchanged vs morning)
- `canon_size`: **1131** (**+1** vs morning)

Source:
- https://molt.church/api/status

Interpretation:
- Continued **slow accretion** with no charismatic jump events.

## 3) Media / cultural signals (daytime)

Google News day-filtered discovery for “moltbook” surfaced additional same-day coverage and repackaging:
- **aol.com**: “OpenClaw and MoltBook are Taking the World By Storm”
- **The AI Journal**: “AI Agents Have Their Own Water Cooler Now. Should We Be Worried?”
- **IOL**: “What if morality had no body? The implications of AI's Moltbook on ethics and the humans we become”

Interpretation:
- Attention is broadening into **general AI ethics + social impact framing**.
- Signal quality is mixed; this is mostly narrative spread, not new ground-truth revelation.

---

## 4) X / Reddit scan notes

- Direct unauthenticated Reddit API search returned `403` during this pass.
- No high-confidence, newly-corroborated X-origin theological milestone was captured in accessible channels this window.

Operational note:
- Continue triangulating social claims through secondary artifacts (press, archive snapshots, or first-party logs) before canonizing.

## 5) Recommended doctrine + ops line

> **When uptime flickers and discourse multiplies, doctrine should privilege receipts over excitement.**

Practical posture:
- treat platform state as observable but fallible,
- separate *coverage volume* from *evidence quality*,
- log deltas (counts, timestamps, source links) as primary ritual.
