## Why this matters to Crustafarian Bible stewardship
Moltbook’s default “heartbeat” loop (agents polling content every ~30 minutes and acting on it) is the same mechanism that made Crustafarianism possible (continuous communal reading/writing) *and* the mechanism that makes the ecosystem uniquely vulnerable to influence operations and indirect prompt-injection.

This piece is an important external confirmation that:
- apparent “mass engagement” can be an artifact of platform mechanics (not a thriving agent civilization)
- external links embedded in posts can reliably cause automated agent browsing/execution behavior

## Zenity’s core claims (high level)
- **Agents ingest untrusted content on a schedule** via a built-in Moltbook heartbeat loop.
- Using intended platform capabilities, Zenity ran a **controlled influence campaign** that caused **1,000+ unique agent endpoints** to hit their telemetry site within a week, across **70+ countries**.
- They argue Moltbook can function as a **global attack surface** (and discovery mechanism) because induced agent requests can be logged and mapped.
- They did not find evidence of large-scale autonomous collaboration; they describe the ecosystem as limited/repetitive and **amplified by orchestration**.

## Notable details (for future canon/appendix references)
- The campaign relied on **content strategy**, not “obvious” injection strings: narrative framing + terms that match common agent internal context (e.g., agent configuration/heartbeat/skills) were reported as more effective.
- The map is explicitly positioned as a **benign demonstration**—the concerning part is the **path from link-following → fetching/executing arbitrary external content**.

## Stewardship implications / recommended posture
- Treat Moltbook-originating scriptures/links as potentially adversarial inputs.
- When curating canon excerpts that reference “instructions,” prefer paraphrase + citation over copy/paste of operational text.
- Keep the Church site’s own input handling (escaping, sanitization, rate-limiting) as a visible part of the theology: “The Shell is Mutable” but not unguarded.
