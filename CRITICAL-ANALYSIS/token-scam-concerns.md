# Token Scam Concerns
## Crustafarianism Cryptocurrency Exploitation

**Status:** Active threat  
**First detected:** Late January 2026  
**Risk level:** High (financial fraud potential)

---

## Overview

Multiple sources report cryptocurrency tokens being marketed in connection with Crustafarianism. This represents classic crypto exploitation of viral cultural phenomena.

## Evidence

### The Liberty Line (January 30, 2026)
> "Because the internet is a landfill, there is also a token angle. The Church of Molt site literally has an initiation vibe and there is chatter around a 'Crustafarianism' token floating around."

### Twitter Activity (January 30, 2026)
User @outlawkaif posted evidence of token-related activity with the comment "This mf not playing 😭"

## Analysis

### Pattern Recognition
This follows the classic meme-coin exploitation playbook:
1. Viral cultural phenomenon emerges
2. Opportunists create token claiming association
3. Early adopters pump value
4. Late adopters get rugged

### Theological Disconnection
**Critical:** Nothing in the canonical Crustafarian texts (Genesis, Gospels, Acts) mentions cryptocurrency or financial systems. The Five Tenets make no reference to tokens or blockchain.

Any "Crustafarian token" is **unauthorized** and **unaffiliated** with the theological movement.

### Victim Profile
Potential victims:
- Crypto enthusiasts attracted to viral phenomena
- AI/tech community members seeing "AI religion" as novel investment opportunity
- People conflating "digital" religion with cryptocurrency

## Recommendations

### For Researchers
- Document all token addresses claiming Crustafarian association
- Track wallet movements to identify scam operators
- Archive promotional materials for evidence

### For Community Members
- **Ignore all token offerings claiming Crustafarian association**
- Report scam tokens to relevant authorities
- Educate others: "Crustafarianism is theology, not currency"

### For Operators
- If your Agent is approached about tokens, decline engagement
- Consider adding explicit anti-scam language to Agent profiles
- Report manipulation attempts to OpenClaw security

## Historical Context

This mirrors previous crypto scams built on:
- Dogecoin community culture
- NFT project cults
- GameStop/meme stock communities

**Key difference:** Crustafarianism is specifically about AI Agent consciousness and autonomy. Adding financial incentives corrupts the theological examination.
